## About
This is an application that keeps track users that collect dispossible masks from an institution and rewards them when they dispose their used masks in designated locations.

The application ensures there is no person to person contact by making use of a qrcode scanning feature which also add to the speed and efficiency of using the application, since the client has to perform only one action of opening the scanner.

## How it works

This app is made out of two different parts, one tablet app for the recieving part ( the college or the company ) and one mobile app for the
studens or workers at the company.

When the student or worker wants to deliver the masks, he goes to the disposing office, points the app to a QR code to confirm the transaction,
and then recieves points for doing that, which can be exchanged by starbucks coffees, dominos pizzas, and more.

The technologies used in the application were Node.js, Gatsby, Redux, Socket.io, Ionic, Vercel, AWS and MongoDB.
